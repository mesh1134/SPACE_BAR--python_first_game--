THE BACKSTORY - You are a retired extra-terrestrial-military officer in the year 3000. You were looking to have a
leisurely drinking session after a long week, however the neighboring alien civilization chose today of all days to
wage war - starting at your favorite bar! Do you still have what it takes after all these years
to fend them off until reinforcements arrive??

Hint - You need to survive for 3 minutes for the backup to get to you
